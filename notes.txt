Experiments:
  in app? or maybe just better as a separate blog

fragrance add temperatures and how it affects cold throw/hot throw
fragrance load and how it affects hot and cold throw

different size of candles with same fragrance load (and in different rooms!) -- any way to try and test this?
  maybe i can make test candles and elicit help from others at brunches etc

pour temperatures
room temperature / jar temperature
wax mixture amounts
  glass adhesion/frosting
  sinkholes

what results can i actually measure?
  total burn time
  melt pool depth after a set time
  cold throw/ hot throw using help from friends

Experiments page
  At least 2 separate batches

  -What is the variable?
  -What is being tested?

  control candles
  experimental candles

  data:
    given a set of candles (control or experimental), get a subset of results like burn time
    can be from the candle data or potentially from its own object store or something

  New Experiment
    description
    hypothesis

    add candles, mark what series it is (control/something experimental)

    get the data for each candle, group by series
    multiple things can be tested


need
  -a way to measure jar temperature given the oven on starts at 170

TODO
inventory screen
  -update amounts remaining
    this helps tracks losses to tests/ experiments etc

search page/ candle lookup

new button in top left of tables like this:
https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/demos/featured/data-editing/

get /batches collection and collection page
get /batches/:id
get /candles/:hashId
put /candles/:hashId edit a candle to add labels boxes owner  completeWeight etc
get /candles collection of candles?
  might be useful for tracking

Is this still relevant?
getBatch needs to return colorDescription.
get Candle needs to remove it.

double check that prices relying on shareOfShippingPercent calculations are programmatically
calculated.

max-width for the candle display? https://codesandbox.io/s/50l225l964?from-embed

display hashIds on components of candle page

fork mokr. and make these changes in the fixture file:
this.up = m.up.bind(this, this.state, this.dependencies);
this.down = m.down.bind(this, this.state, this.dependencies);

a way way to "finish" a package/fo/wick pack etc on candle/batch submit
after submit in all these forms, clear the damn form. and redirect or whatever

new batch-> batchItem dialog isn't a form.

GET candle-burns endpoint
returns total burn time + array of burns sorted new to old

candle page update-able fields:
finishedBurning checkbox on candlepage
recent burns small table display--and highlight a pending entry pink

inventory routes:
  info about a particular item:
    get /<resource-type>/:hashId
  update info for a particular item:
    put /<resource-type>/:hashId

  get collection of resource-type aka see all wicks
  (post is handled by the supply-orders concept)
    get /<resource-type>

batch page update-able fields:
color--updates all candle layers

handle owners
update candle autocomplete with people's names or something

DELETE route and PUT routes for orders/candles/batches that is linked in the snackbar returned would be helpful

update-candle response should maybe return a get-candle request and show a snackbar

recent batches route to display on the main screen or something.
   so subsequent layers can be easily added and current layers can be weighed from the future

server creates default candle name based on fragrance oils used

the tables are kind of gross and don't use space very well.
maybe a custom div list rendered through https://virtuoso.dev/?path=/story/features-overview--auto-resizing would be nice

GET candle-layer or get batch-layers should probably handle this and return wax/db/fo at the layer level

batches page / batch endpoint is a little useless.
needs to be editable for the color field.
needs to show calculatedPourWeight instead of prepped weight
batch-layers should return costs of fos/waxes/dbs

Navigation
  inventory routes
  recent candles
  recent batches

Fragrance Load might need another decimal. looks like .75 rounds up to 8%

Add a color picker to the candle + batch pages

rewrite all calculated cost things to always use a float until the very end

better transition from new-candles to giving you the hashIds

autocomplete components need some sort of lookup by hash_id endpoint
  sorted by id desc
  react-autosuggest looks nice
  endpoints for
    candles
    FOs
    waxes
    dbs
    jars
    lids
    wicks
    wick_stickers
    etc


node canvas to create labels programmatically

clear order page after submission
deleting a layer doesnt update the wax to fill numbers
Checkbox for finishing an oil/block/wax/jar/wick/etc
-- when hit you can make up the remainder with another one somehow
shift all dye blocks to weight and add liquid_dye resource

some way to handle pre-mixed wax from presto-pot
basically create wax blend.
also create a wick.

oils:
Compare all 4 patchoulis in small candles and decide which i like best.
tobacco comparison? pas tobacco fillmore several from flaming candle AAA

compare CS and fillmores leather in candles. and another. cant decide.
chocolate between flaming candle and cocoa therapy fillmore. out of the bottle fillmore is better.
I prefer Fillmore's French Vanilla to CS Very Vanilla but need to use my VV up
fillmore grapefruit ftw
flaming candle beer smells amazing out of the bottle.
lonestar oakmoss ftw
fillmore green apple is excellent for fall

autocomplete have a filter for not finished

root beer float options:
htp 104 (good option but bit of soot on a mid jar burn. all the way throuh this might have been the best actually. maybe enforce a trimmed wick?)
cd8 (great option, tiny bit of soot on one burn)
cdn8 (excellent option after 3 burns)
lx-18 (a bit hot in mid jar. cool at 2/3 burn. smaller would be too small at the bottom. bigger too big at the top prob.)
zinc 44-32 (too small, try one size up)

Current Todo List:
create a wax blend from multiple waxes. this could eventually use infinity bottle logic?
dyePercentage of total, suggested dye amount based on that field on new-batch page
suggested weight on new-batch page is wonky after marking finished, then re-editing to unfinish
edit burn end point and FE integration  
add candle name to new-batch page layer popout or something. this might need a candle hash lookup, etc
confirmation links, msds sheets, ifra certificates, vanillin content/ ethyl vanillin, flashpoint, pthalate free
client-api ping route or something to make sure its all connected--looks like this route already exists
some way to save candle "recipes"
autocomplete routes from hash_id
Candle Weight Target instead of jar fill percentage (keep these fields linked together?)
recent batches route
inventory routes
search candle route and search form by fragrance/wax/dye name etc
some way to track previous candles that a jar was used for? or at least track its original cost. 
  when a jar is "recycled" let its cost in the new-order be negative the original cost * some depreciation factor

 options for a more complex burn log:
    full melt pool, mp depth, mushrooming amount, jar temp at hottest, flame size, smoke on blowout, soot
  burn graph in burn-history dialog weight vs burn-time. end points show tootips of date or something

Candle todos:
compare leather from aztec fillmore and CS
compare patchouli from aztec cs fillmore lonestar
compare tobaccos
  aztec tobacco 1oz
  pa's tobacco pipe LS
  tuscan tobacco AAA
  Pipe tobacco FC
  Tobacco Caramel FC
  Tobacco and Bay Leaf FC
Vetiver wick testing
Citrus wick testing?

Finalize CCv2?
vetiver star anise?
Test french vanilla vs very vanilla
Blood orange / Vanilla vs orange spice AAA / vanilla?

Test wick trimming various amounts. VERY short, 1/8, 1/4 (premiers seem to need ridiculously short trim)
Test cure times
Test dyes

Test Patchouli FOs

Make some Fig-Bergs for curing / gifts
CS Silver tumbler tests
Cali short jar tests--double wick
Cali small jar tests
Research Label options
  Silhouette 4 Vinyl, drawing on labels, benefits of using illustrator? export svgs? auto generate svgs? node canvas?
