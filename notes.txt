Experiments:
  in app? or maybe just better as a separate blog

fragrance add temperatures and how it affects cold throw/hot throw
fragrance load and how it affects hot and cold throw

different size of candles with same fragrance load (and in different rooms!) -- any way to try and test this?
  maybe i can make test candles and elicit help from others at brunches etc

pour temperatures
room temperature / jar temperature
wax mixture amounts
  glass adhesion/frosting
  sinkholes

what results can i actually measure?
  total burn time
  melt pool depth after a set time
  cold throw/ hot throw using help from friends

Experiments page
  At least 2 separate batches

  -What is the variable?
  -What is being tested?

  control candles
  experimental candles

  data:
    given a set of candles (control or experimental), get a subset of results like burn time
    can be from the candle data or potentially from its own object store or something

  New Experiment
    description
    hypothesis

    add candles, mark what series it is (control/something experimental)

    get the data for each candle, group by series
    multiple things can be tested


need
  -a way to measure jar temperature given the oven on starts at 170

TODO
inventory screen
  -update amounts remaining
    this helps tracks losses to tests/ experiments etc

search page/ candle lookup

add jar form to allow for jars not associated with orders/ recycled jars/ free jars
this can probably just be the reg order form with a recycled checkbox by the jar

new button in top left of tables like this:
https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/demos/featured/data-editing/

get /batches collection and collection page
get /batches/:id
get /candles/:hashId
put /candles/:hashId edit a candle to add labels boxes owner  completeWeight etc
get /candles collection of candles?
  might be useful for tracking

Is this still relevant?
getBatch needs to return colorDescription.
get Candle needs to remove it.

double check that prices relying on shareOfShippingPercent calculations are programmatically
calculated.

max-width for the candle display? https://codesandbox.io/s/50l225l964?from-embed

what are aria labels? all over the dialog.
and htmlFor on InputLabels

display hashIds on components of candle page

fork mokr. and make these changes in the fixture file:
this.up = m.up.bind(this, this.state, this.dependencies);
this.down = m.down.bind(this, this.state, this.dependencies);

a way way to "finish" a package/fo/wick pack etc on candle/batch submit
after submit in all these forms, clear the damn form. and redirect or whatever

new batch-> batchItem dialog isn't a form.

GET candle-burns endpoint
returns total burn time + array of burns sorted new to old

candle page update-able fields:
finishedBurning checkbox on candlepage
recent burns small table display--and highlight a pending entry pink

inventory routes:
  info about a particular item:
    get /<resource-type>/:hashId
  update info for a particular item:
    put /<resource-type>/:hashId

  get collection of resource-type aka see all wicks
  (post is handled by the supply-orders concept)
    get /<resource-type>

batch page update-able fields:
color--updates all candle layers

handle owners
update candle autocomplete with people's names or something

DELETE route and PUT routes for orders/candles/batches that is linked in the snackbar returned would be helpful

update-candle response should maybe return a get-candle request and show a snackbar

recent batches route to display on the main screen or something.
   so subsequent layers can be easily added and current layers can be weighed from the future

server creates candle name based on fragrance oils used

the tables are kind of gross and don't use space very well.
maybe a custom div list rendered through https://virtuoso.dev/?path=/story/features-overview--auto-resizing would be nice

candle page price of batchItems in layer dialog is for the whole batch.
doesn't consider the percent of batch for the layer.
GET candle-layer or get batch-layers should probably handle this and return wax/db/fo at the layer level

batches page / batch endpoint is a little useless.
needs to be editable for the color field.
needs to show calculatedPourWeight instead of prepped weight
batch-layers should return costs of fos/waxes/dbs

Navigation
  inventory routes
  recent candles
  recent batches

Fragrance Load might need another decimal. looks like .75 rounds up to 8%

Add a color picker to the candle + batch pages

but weight of fo/wax on batch page and candle page layer
rewrite all calculated cost things to always use a float until the very end

better transition from new-candles to giving you the hashIds

go from new-candle to new-batch with some pre-populated fields
  new-batch?candles=WBZW,ABCD,DEFG
put the actual amount of each FO on the candle and batch page--more than just name and price

autocomplete components need some sort of lookup by hash_id endpoint
  sorted by id desc
  react-autosuggest looks nice
  endpoints for
    candles
    FOs
    waxes
    dbs
    jars
    lids
    wicks
    wick_stickers
    etc

Duplicate candle button

node canvas to create labels programmatically
