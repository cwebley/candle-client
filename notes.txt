Experiments:
  in app? or maybe just better as a separate blog

fragrance add temperatures and how it affects cold throw/hot throw
fragrance load and how it affects hot and cold throw

different size of candles with same fragrance load (and in different rooms!) -- any way to try and test this?
  maybe i can make test candles and elicit help from others at brunches etc

pour temperatures
room temperature / jar temperature
wax mixture amounts
  glass adhesion/frosting
  sinkholes

what results can i actually measure?
  total burn time
  melt pool depth after a set time
  cold throw/ hot throw using help from friends

Experiments page
  At least 2 separate batches

  -What is the variable?
  -What is being tested?

  control candles
  experimental candles

  data:
    given a set of candles (control or experimental), get a subset of results like burn time
    can be from the candle data or potentially from its own object store or something

  New Experiment
    description
    hypothesis

    add candles, mark what series it is (control/something experimental)

    get the data for each candle, group by series
    multiple things can be tested


need
  -a way to measure jar temperature given the oven on starts at 170

TODO
inventory screen
  -update amounts remaining
    this helps tracks losses to tests/ experiments etc

search page/ candle lookup

new button in top left of tables like this:
https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-reactive/react/grid/demos/featured/data-editing/

get /batches collection and collection page
get /batches/:id
get /candles/:hashId
put /candles/:hashId edit a candle to add labels boxes owner  completeWeight etc
get /candles collection of candles?
  might be useful for tracking

Is this still relevant?
getBatch needs to return colorDescription.
get Candle needs to remove it.

double check that prices relying on shareOfShippingPercent calculations are programmatically
calculated.

max-width for the candle display? https://codesandbox.io/s/50l225l964?from-embed

display hashIds on components of candle page

fork mokr. and make these changes in the fixture file:
this.up = m.up.bind(this, this.state, this.dependencies);
this.down = m.down.bind(this, this.state, this.dependencies);

a way way to "finish" a package/fo/wick pack etc on candle/batch submit
after submit in all these forms, clear the damn form. and redirect or whatever

new batch-> batchItem dialog isn't a form.

GET candle-burns endpoint
returns total burn time + array of burns sorted new to old

candle page update-able fields:
finishedBurning checkbox on candlepage
recent burns small table display--and highlight a pending entry pink

inventory routes:
  info about a particular item:
    get /<resource-type>/:hashId
  update info for a particular item:
    put /<resource-type>/:hashId

  get collection of resource-type aka see all wicks
  (post is handled by the supply-orders concept)
    get /<resource-type>

batch page update-able fields:
color--updates all candle layers

handle owners
update candle autocomplete with people's names or something

DELETE route and PUT routes for orders/candles/batches that is linked in the snackbar returned would be helpful

update-candle response should maybe return a get-candle request and show a snackbar

recent batches route to display on the main screen or something.
   so subsequent layers can be easily added and current layers can be weighed from the future

server creates candle name based on fragrance oils used

the tables are kind of gross and don't use space very well.
maybe a custom div list rendered through https://virtuoso.dev/?path=/story/features-overview--auto-resizing would be nice

GET candle-layer or get batch-layers should probably handle this and return wax/db/fo at the layer level

batches page / batch endpoint is a little useless.
needs to be editable for the color field.
needs to show calculatedPourWeight instead of prepped weight
batch-layers should return costs of fos/waxes/dbs

Navigation
  inventory routes
  recent candles
  recent batches

Fragrance Load might need another decimal. looks like .75 rounds up to 8%

Add a color picker to the candle + batch pages

rewrite all calculated cost things to always use a float until the very end

better transition from new-candles to giving you the hashIds

autocomplete components need some sort of lookup by hash_id endpoint
  sorted by id desc
  react-autosuggest looks nice
  endpoints for
    candles
    FOs
    waxes
    dbs
    jars
    lids
    wicks
    wick_stickers
    etc


node canvas to create labels programmatically

clear order page after submission
deleting a layer doesnt update the wax to fill numbers
Checkbox for finishing an oil/block/wax/jar/wick/etc
-- when hit you can make up the remainder with another one somehow
shift all dye blocks to weight and add liquid_dye resource

remaining coco83-5% bees wick tests:
todo: 

double premier 710 and 720 (ordered)
cd-7 (ordered)

HTP-31 and CD-2 are kind of great.
update: CD-2 self extinguished.

coco83-3% tests? 11% FO


Double P725 // drowns out second burn half jar
Double CD-2
Double CD-3 // seems the best so far
Double HTP-31
Double Eco-1


Double P735 drowned.
Double HTP-41 drowned.
Single HTP 104 mushroom, tiny bit of soot. otherwise good
Single P775 soot, mushroom, maybe a bit big
Single P780 same as above


Zinc wick tests
Wooden wick tests

Thicker jars might help make double Eco-1 viable.

Hotter Again:

Double P-745
Double HTP-52
Single P765

Decent Wick Candidates

Double
Zinc 28-24 too cool
Zinc 34-40 too hot

Eco 1 Okay. Pretty hot jar.

CD-3 Pretty good. Got a little cool at some point.  and very hot at others. yellow melt pool?
CD-2 Also pretty good, but didn't quite survive the low oxy phase. much too small in the soy blends. maybe in all. yellow melt pool.

HTP-41 Drowned out, too cool maybe worth trying in different wax
HTP-52 Also drowned out. might be from trimming too short? idk.

Small Premiers all drown. Maybe run a test series with a final wax

Select a final wax.

Try these 14:
P-720, P-725, P-735, 745
HTP-31, HTP-41, HTP-52, HTP-62
Zinc 28-24 /  34-40 / 36-24
CD-2/ CD-3 and monitor container temp. These always get yellow and drown it seems
Eco-1 and monitor container temp.


Single
Zinc 44-32 little soot and lots of mushrooming but otherwise decent option
Zinc 51-32 same as above somehow

HTP-93 Solid option. needs a bit more heat to get the sides. but works as is.
HTP-104 Way too big, tons of soot.

P-780, P-775 Pretty good, big flame, and some soot on both.
P-765 on the verge of being useful, but not full melt pool without a crazy long burn. mushrooming.

CD-7: tons of soot.

Try these 15:
HTP-93 and HTP-104
CD-6 CD-7
CDN 6/ 8
Eco 6/ 8
LX 16/ 18
P-765/ P-767 / P-775
Zinc 44-32/ Zinc-51-32-18

change the order of the defaults on the batch page so FO temps are next to each other and room/jar temps too
total wax weight doesnt update after editing a wax

some way to handle pre-mixed wax from presto-pot
basically create wax blend.
also create a wick.

oils:
Compare all 4 patchoulis in small candles and decide which i like best.
tobacco comparison? pas tobacco fillmore several from flaming candle AAA

compare CS and fillmores leather in candles. and another. cant decide.
chocolate between flaming candle and cocoa therapy fillmore. out of the bottle fillmore is better.
I prefer Fillmore's French Vanilla to CS Very Vanilla but need to use my VV up
fillmore grapefruit ftw
flaming candle beer smells amazing out of the bottle.
lonestar oakmoss ftw
fillmore green apple is excellent for fall

autocomplete have a filter for not finished

P775
LX-18
HTP-104

jar fill percentage on new-batch form doesn't let you backspace it all the way

Current Todo List:

finished checkbox next to item on new-candle page
add more items from new-batch page into query
add weight to burns
display client side burns
client-api ping route or something to make sure its all connected
convert all dye-block amounts to weights if the small amounts are measureable with my scale
add liquid dye as a resource
confirmation links, msds sheets, ifra certificates, vanillin content
autocomplete routes from hash_id
recent batches route
inventory routes
search candle route and search form by fragrance/wax/dye name etc

root beer float options:
htp 104 (good option but bit of soot on a mid jar burn. all the way throuh this might have been the best actually. maybe enforce a trimmed wick?)
cd8 (great option, tiny bit of soot on one burn)
cdn8 (excellent optiona after 3 burns)
lx-18 (a bit hot in mid jar. cool at 2/3 burn. smaller would be too small at the bottom. bigger too big at the top prob.)
zinc 44-32 (too small, try one size up)

Candle todos:
RBF more options
English Honey Wood small test run to see if fragrance good etc
English Honey Wood bigger test run
English Honey Wood final candidates test
Fig-Bergamot full candles again 777 and 780 to completely decide.
Make some Fig-Bergs for curing / gifts
Cali short jar tests--double wick, triple wicks
Cali small jar tests
Candle Science copper tumbler test
Research Label options
  Cricut/Silhouette Vinyl
  Printers and online labels
  Illustrator to create labels and print them
test hurricane glasses for asthetics, draft reduction
