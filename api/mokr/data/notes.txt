Candle Care Card

== Clock or hourglass icon. or stop hand.
- Let the candle cure for at least 4 days
    - This gives the wax a chance to settle and locks in the fragrance

== Clock or hourglass. or candle with dashed melt pool. screenshot on desktop 4/11/22
- Allow the melt pool to reach the edge of the glass
    - Plan to keep the candle burning for at least 2 hours each burn, and up to 4 hours on the first burn.
    - This helps prevents tunneling

== Wick + flame icon
- Keep the wick healthy!
    - Trim wick to 1/4 inch before each burn
    - Pluck off any excess carbon buildup from the tip
    - To extinguish, dip the wicks into the wax, then restraighten the wick

== Brain icon. or no pets/babies/wind
-Be mindful! 
    - Keep a burning candle away from pets, kids, drafts, and flamable materials.    
    - Don't leave a burning candle unattended
